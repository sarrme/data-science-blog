            What is a probability? 
            </p>


            <p>
            I've always wondered about this question, a probability, could I make sense of it. Before discussing any machine learning algorithm, it is important to fully understand the vocabulary associated with the concept of probability. 
            </p> 
            <p>
            Let's understand what probability is. Probability is a way to quantify the likelihood of an event occurring, it is something we do in our daily lives. For example, when you talk to someone about the weather, you'll probably tell them "it's probably going to rain today, isn't it" if the day is cloudy. Probability quantifies this perception by associating a number between 0 and 1 with the certainty that the event will happen, with probability 1, the event is certain, 0 is impossible.  The space we are working in, includes all possible events, for example the fact that it rains or it doesn't rain are two events that encompass all possible events, the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} describes all possible values of rolling a die, the event of flipping a coin could give only two possible values: a head or a tail, and for the latter the event of rolling an unbiased coin (not favoring one side over the other) will give a head with a probability of 0.5 and a tail with the same probability, these are only the two possible outcomes and they have equal probability. </p>
            <p>
            Mathematically, we refer to the event space as \(\Omega\). The probability of all events occurring is 1, which corresponds to the equation \(P(\Omega)=1\). If we denote a specific event by \(A\), then the complementary event is written \(\overline{A}\). With probability, we express our perception in the form of a mathematical formula. For example, if we take two events \(A\) and \(B\) that cannot occur at the same time, it is logical that the event that is described as the two events (we write this event as an intersection (\(A \cap B\)) occurring is 0, which is expressed as \(P(A \cup B) = 0\), the event that \(A\) occurs or \(B\) occurs is a sum of the two probabilities, either will occur, it makes sense to write the probability as a sum, \(P(A \cup B)=P(A) + P(B)\). The intersection of two events is not always 0, for example, suppose we roll two dice one after the other, we designate \(A\) as the event, we get 1 in the first die, B as the event we get 1 in the second die, the intersection is quite obvious in this case, we get 1 when we roll the first die and 1 in the second. The probability is not 0, because the event can occur without any doubt. The event that the first event occurs or the second event occurs is expressed in another way, we will not go into details but we give the formula, \(P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)\).

            <p>
            We initially said that it is more likely to rain if the sky is cloudy, this is called the conditional probability. The probability that it will rain is conditioned by the fact that the sky is cloudy, you assume that the sky is cloudy as a fact and you look for the probability of the weather. The conditional probability can be expressed mathematically as : 
            \(P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}\)
